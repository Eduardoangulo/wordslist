# Wordslist
Words List challenge

# Explanation 
Write a console application that processes a word list. The application should print all the 6-letter words from the list, that can be obtained by concatenating two other words from the list.
An example: The word “albums” is printed, because the words “al”, “bums” and “albums” are in the word list.

Print the result as follows:
al + bums => albums 
bar + ely => barely 
be + foul => befoul
con + vex => convex
here + by => hereby
jig + saw => jigsaw
tail + or => tailor
we + aver => weaver
